This file contains the PIMA Indian diabetes dataset. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, blood pressure, skin thickness and diabetes pedigree function.

Diabetes.ipynb:-
This is a python notebook which contains the code of the project.
I have done EDA, Pre-processing and Model Training. I have then compared the accuracy of every model I applied and selected the best model.
Model applied are as follows:-
Logistic Regression (LR)
K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
Decision Tree (DT)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting (GB)
Random Forest (RF)
XG Boosting(XGB)
Extra Trees(ET)
Voting Classifier(VC)
Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes(GNB)
Stacking Classifier(SC)
Bagging Classifier]]
Aritificial Neural Networks

I have explained the code step by step in this video.

DiabetesReport_VedantSawant.pdf:-
This is the report I have created for the project. It contains literature survey of existing system, proposed methodology etc.

Diabetesppt_VedantSawant.ppt:-
This is the ppt I have created from the report.
